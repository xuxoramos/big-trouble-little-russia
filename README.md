## Ch 1: "If we're not back by dawn...call the president"
### I
The dreg crawled back to consciousness. She started opening her eyes. She saw the nightsky. This means she was lying on her back.
-"Remember training. First, bearings. Water, shallow water. Lying on a puddle. Pain and cold, everywhere. Try move arms. Arms move. Get up now".
She tried to get up and felt a sharp pain where her other arms were before they were docked at her initiation. She looked down and saw her suit charred and felt wounds beneath. She was leaking ether, and needed to find a servitor before running out of it and die. Her surroundings were an Eliksni massacre, but she was used to it. She grabbed a wire rifle from a dead vandal and started looking for a way to keep herself alive.

The cosmodrome offered little refuge. She could hear skirmishes and gunfire to the distance. She just needed to find a servitor, but with not one in sight, and with these dead and alive humans hunting them, she chose to find a cave or hollow in the wall's structure and wait. She started to reminisce. Her name was Vilkris, she remembered that. She remembered belonging to House of Devils before Ghaul came and stripped them from what little they had. She remembered that her house was the only one left that taught their younglings about The Great Machine and The Whirlwind. She remembered that The Great Machine abandoned them and that they were here in a remote planet and at war with The Last City to try to recover it. She had heard the stories about how it granted the blessing of eternal life to these humans. That would be good in these moments. Just have the little lights resurrect her in a few moments when she finally died. Resurrect. Free. Without hunger. Without the need for a servitor to feed her. Without hunger. Without feeding on the leftovers from a vandal. Without hunger. Without hunger.

The servitor started humming while synthesizing the ether necessary for her to start healing. The sound echoed through the abandoned section of the wall they were in, only matched by the deaf whirr of a light pointing towards the charred parts of her suit. She was no longer leaking ether, and slowly regained consciousness. She woke up  with the same fixated idea. To be free from the hunger. She saw the servitor, but quickly turned away in shame. How come a noble and dignified race as the Eliksni were now forced into scavenging? Reluctantly, she continued to feed on the ether. It felt so good to be rid of the constant hunger, and apparently there were no others like her she had to share the servitor with, so she could keep feeding until satisfied, though she know this solace would be short-lived. It then dawned on her. She needed these machines to survive. As long as this link persisted, the Eliksni were fragile. They needed a way to survive without them and without their Archons to decide who feeds less and who feeds more. They needed a different type of house. She began to remember her lessons about how these humans, dead and alive huamans, had a House Vanguard, with three leaders, but no Archon to take care of The Great Machine. It all served for killing, however, as House Vanguard did not need to carry The Great Machine with them at all times. All they needed was the little lights that followed them. So, perhaps she, them, all Eliksni, did not need to steal back The Great Machine, but only its little lights with strange forms. If this could be done, then they would have the same power as those dead and alive humans, and live forever, but most important, live without hunger.
